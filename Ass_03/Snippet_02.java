ï‚· Error to investigate: Why does the loop not execute as expected? What is the issue with the condition in the `while` loop?
--->The condition while (count = 0) causes a compilation error because = is an assignment, not a comparison but if we use a comparison operator  
    the loop never runs because count == 0 is false initially. so Use while (count > 0) to run loop correctly while  count is positive */
